  "Like most Data Scientists these days, I learnt (and am still learning) the techniques on the job. Back in 2014, I graduated with a scientific degree which taught me the foundations of data analysis, statistics and visualisation. After that, I fell into Data Science and landed my first job as a Data Scientist. Probably a familiar story for others out there too?",
  "Earning the job title of â€˜Data Scientistâ€™ without having a directly related qualification was odd to me. I knew a few of the concepts, had worked with relational databases and dabbled in a small amount of code, but that was pretty much it. I also wasnâ€™t as dedicated to learning back then as I am now, so most topics I learnt were dictated by the projects I was working on at the time.",
  "As a few years passed, Data Science grew massively in popularity as a career path. As more online resources became available and data professionals were getting churned out of dedicated Data Science programmes, I realised I was getting left behind. My coding skills were underdeveloped, my statistics knowledge was rusty and my analytical approach to solving problems was quite frankly, primitive."
